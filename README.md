Export chatlog as a <a href="https://sprites.neocities.org/logs/reader">Sprites</a> readble file.

Requires:
- Catbox account. Generate user hash [here](https://catbox.moe/user/manage.php).
- [SillyLogs-Catbox](https://github.com/RedIceCider/SillyLogs-Catbox) plugin (recommended) or a CORS proxy.

To use the plugin, you need to set `enableServerPlugins` to `true` in your SillyTavern `config.yaml` file.
